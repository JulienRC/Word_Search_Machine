# Word Search Machine

  This is a lab project of my third year of university degree in computer science.
The goal of the project is to implement a word search machine. You add some files which contain words and the words are placed in a array with a hash code.
There is an array for the file you add and there is an array for the words in the file. If different words are placed in the same place in the array, they are placed after so it became a list of words (each structure of word have a pointer to the next structure).

# How to use it

  You can create some file in .txt with one word per line. You run word_search_machine.exe and follow the instruction :)
